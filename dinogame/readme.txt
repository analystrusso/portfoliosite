Adam's Dino Game v.1.0

This is a home-made verison of Google Chrome's sidescrolling dino game. I made it using a YouTube tutorial. It's a lot less sophisticated as of right now -- it only has the dino, a single cactus, collision detection, and a game over alert. Run the index.html file to play the game, press any key to jump, and refresh the page to restart the game. 

Future improvements:

- a score counter for consecutive successful jumps: DONE!
- a dedicated restart button so you don't have to refresh the page manually.
- more varied obstacles.
