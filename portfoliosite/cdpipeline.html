        </div>

        <div class="container">
            <p>
                This lab focused on creating a continuous delivery pipeline using an external Git repository, a web app deployed via AWS Elastic Beanstalk, and connected using CodeBuild and CodePipeline. Thus, any change to the Git repo would be automatically passsed to CodeBuild for assembly and then to Elastic Beanstalk via CodePipeline for deployment. One of the last steps involved creating a manual approval step for quality assurance, and even though this site runs on a CodeDeploy pipeline from Github to Amplify, it got me thinking about rerunning it through CodeBuild too.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Step 1</h4>
            <p>
                The first step was to fork an existing Git repository (https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-elastic-beanstalk-express-js-sample) so I could have my own copy of it. I then cloned the repo locally and changed the default "Hello World!" message to "All that is gold does not glitter; not all those who wander are lost." I added, committed, and pushed the change, and found that my git repo had indeed been updated to reflect my changes.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Step 2</h4>
            <p>
                The second step was to configure and create an AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment, then deploy a sample web app to it for testing. I followed the instructions as written until I needed to choose an existing service role and EC2 instance profile. I didn't have any at the moment, so I followed the instructions found <a href="//docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/getting-started-create-iam-instance-profile.html">here</a> to make them using the AWS CLI. Once the environment was set up, I tested it by opening its domain to find a cheerful "Congratulations" message indicating a successful test. At this point, the architecture is simply Users>Git Repo, and off in the distance, the Beanstalk environment, but that will soon change.
            </p>
                
            <br>
            <h4>Step 3</h4>
            <p>
                Next, I got my first taste of AWS CodeBuild. This service builds out the source code from my Git repo, runs tests on it, and packages the resulting software so they're ready to deploy. To accomplish all this, I first connected CodeBuild to my Git repo and spun up an EC2 instance. The EC2 instance was part of the CodeBuild project setup, so I could set it up without leaving the CodeBuild page. I then added a premade Buildspec file:
                <br>
                <pre>version: 0.2
                    phases:
                        build:
                            commands:
                                - npm i --save
                    artifacts:
                        files:
                            - '**/*'</pre>
                <br>
                Finally, the CodeBuild project was ready for testing. I did so, and passed without issues.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Step 4</h4>
            <p>
                This step saw the creation of a pipeline using the aptly-named AWS CodePipeline service. CodePipeline sets up a continuous delivery pipeline with source, build, and deploy stages. The pipeline detects changes in the Github repo's code and then automatically passes that code through CodeBuild to Elastic Beanstalk for deployment.
            </p>
            <p>
                This step had a lot of parts to it, but they all went relatively quickly and smoothly. First up, making the pipeline in AWS CodePipeline. Next, I configured the source stage to use the Github repo I set up at the beginning using Github webhooks. I selected AWS CodeBuild for the build stage, and the project I had already set up there in a previous step. Then I set Elastic Beanstalk as the provider, and used the app and environment names I had already set for those respective fields. Then the pipeline was ready to be built. I watched the pipeline execute for the first time and, when I checked the app URL from Elastic Beanstalk, I found that it had changed to show to text I entered in. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Step 5</h4>
            <p>
                Lastly, I added a manual review stage to the pipeline so an administrator or engineer can review and approve changes before they're deployed to the app. This is an important quality assurance step that can prevent unintended mistakes or bugs from ending up in the finished application. I made another addition to the text the app displays on its page, pushed the commit to the repo, monitored the pipeline, manually approved the change, and refreshed the app page once deployment was done to see the new change in action. The whole thing was really cool!
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Step 6</h4>
            <p>
                As with my other labs, the final step in this lab is all about cleanup. In an effort to control costs and because I have no need to keep this application active, I went back through the steps and dismantled the application service by service.
