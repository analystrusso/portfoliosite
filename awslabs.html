            <p>
                I made a simple web application using AWS Amplify, Lambda, API Gateway, and 
                DynamoDB that consisted of a website that asks for a first and last name. Then,
                when you click on the Call API button, a pop-up appears that says "Hello from 
                Lambda (first name) (last name)" Then each name pair gets 
                logged in the DynamoDB table so I can see each time the API was called. I had a 
                surprisingly hard time with this because I kept getting a CORS error. Turns out 
                that I didn't copy/paste the API invoke URL exactly right, and once I did that,
                it worked like a charm. A summary of what I did follows, with full original instructions found here: <a href=https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-web-app-s3-lambda-api-gateway-dynamodb/>Build a Basic Web Application</a>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Step 1</h4>
            <p>
                The first thing I did was make a rudimentary "Hello World" web app using
                AWS Amplify. I deployed it locally without Git by drag-and-dropping the 
                index.html file into the Amplify console. So far, users will be able to
                visit the index.html URL and see "Hello world!" Not very exciting yet, 
                but it's an important first step.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Step 2</h4>
            <p>
                Step two involved making a Lambda function. Lambda functions are serverless,
                which means they're on-demand and I don't have to configure the underlying
                infrastructure -- they just work when needed. Click on the button to see the
                Python I used for it:
            </p>
            <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#lambda">Code Snippet</button>
            <div id="lambda" class="collapse">
                <pre>
                    #import the JSON utility package since we will be working with a JSON object
                    import json
                    # define the handler function that the Lambda service will use as an entry point
                    def lambda_handler(event, context):
                    # extract values from the event object we got from the Lambda service
                    name = event['firstName'] +' '+ event['lastName']
                    # return a properly formatted JSON object
                    return {
                        'statusCode': 200,
                        'body': json.dumps('Hello from Lambda, ' + name)
                        }
                </pre>
                </div>
                <p>
                    I deployed and tested the function and made sure it returned no errors.
                </p>
                
            <br>
            <h4>Step 3</h4>
            <p>
                The next step had me make a REST API using AWS API Gateway. This API used
                a POST method, and I linked it to the Lambda function I made in Step 2. 
                I then enabled CORS, or Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, to allow communication
                with the API. Once I made and deployed the API, I tested it by manually inputting a 
                first and last name. When I received a Code 200 as a response, I moved to 
                the next step.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Step 4</h4>
            <p>
                Now that the app is deployed and the API and Lambda function are communicating,
                I needed to make a database to store the first name and last name pairs in a 
                persistant fashion so I could track how many API calls there were, and when they
                were made. To accomplish this, I used AWS' noSQL database service DynamoDB.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course I needed to grant permission for the Lambda function to write to the
                database, so I added an inline IAM policy to do so. Remember the code I showed you
                in Step 2? That isn't actually the final code, but this is:
            </p>
            <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#finallambda">Code Snippet</button>
            <div id="finallambda" class="collapse">
                <pre>
                    # import the json utility package since we will be working with a JSON object
                    import json
                    # import the AWS SDK (for Python the package name is boto3)
                    import boto3
                    # import time 
                    import time
                    # import two packages to help us with dates and date formatting

                    # create a DynamoDB object using the AWS SDK
                    dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')
                    # use the DynamoDB object to select our table
                    table = dynamodb.Table('HelloWorldDatabase')

                    # define the handler function that the Lambda service will use as an entry point
                    def lambda_handler(event, context):
                    # Get the current GMT time
                        gmt_time = time.gmtime()

                        # store the current time in a human readable format in a variable
                        # Format the GMT time string
                        now = time.strftime('%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S +0000', gmt_time)


                    # extract values from the event object we got from the Lambda service and store in a variable
                        name = event['firstName'] +' '+ event['lastName']
                    # write name and time to the DynamoDB table using the object we instantiated and save response in a variable
                        response = table.put_item(
                            Item={
                                'ID': name,
                                'LatestGreetingTime':now
                                })
                    # return a properly formatted JSON object
                        return {
                            'statusCode': 200,
                            'body': json.dumps('Hello from Lambda, ' + name)
                        }
                </pre>
        </div>
        <p>
            After testing to make sure the database can communicate with Lambda, I had the 
            following architecture: my REST API could talk to Lambda, which could then talk to
            DynamoDB. AWS Identity and Access Management gave permission for communication, but
            the Amplify frontend is still disconnected from the back.
        </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Step 5</h4>
            <p>
                The first thing to do now is to replace the basic Hello World HTML from Step 1 with something a bit more interesting:

            </div>
            <p>
                This is the interface as the user sees it: they enter a first and last name, click Call API, and are returned a personalized message based on the names they entered.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Step 6</h4>
            <p>
                The final step in this lab is all about cleanup. In an effort to control costs and because I have no need to keep this application active, I went back through the steps and dismantled the application service by service.
