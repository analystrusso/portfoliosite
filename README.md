Portfolio Website README:

This project is a catch-all for my self-directed cloud/web development training, and it's also a neat place to show off some of my favorite digital paintings.
The site itself is made with HTML and Bootstrap CSS for the most part, with some JavaScript thrown in here and there for good measure. The Hurdles game project,
which is an iteration on Google's dino game (https://chromedino.com/), was written mostly in JavaScript. I also have a list of several cloud projects that I've
undertaken along with what they were and how I did them. Any and all changes or additions I make to my site are reflected here, and the main purpose of this repo
is to give a look behind the proverbial curtain.
